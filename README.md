## 📁 Folder Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `classification/` | Notebooks using supervised classification methods (KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, etc.) |
| `clustering/` | Unsupervised clustering techniques like K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means |
| `preprocessing/` | Data preprocessing tasks including outlier handling and feature scaling |
| `regression/` | Regression tasks like predicting continuous variables |
| `projects/` | End-to-end or combined models including CNN, LSTM, and image tasks |
| `utils/` | Miscellaneous utilities or feature engineering tools |

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and switch to this branch:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-tasks.git
cd ml-tasks
git checkout other-tasks
```

2. Install dependencies (create your own environment):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
