# 🧠 Machine Learning Tasks – Master Repository

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Tasks** repository! This is the main branch that provides an overview and structure of two focused branches:
- 📘 `assignment` – Educational exercises covering fundamental ML concepts.
- 🧪 `brainstrom zone` – A diverse set of ML mini-projects and applied tasks.

---

## 📂 Branch Overview

### [`assignment`](https://github.com/yourusername/ml-tasks/tree/Assignment)
A set of structured Jupyter notebooks focused on:
- Core ML algorithms (Linear Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees)
- Evaluation metrics and mathematical foundations
- Feature selection and preprocessing
- Ensemble techniques like Random Forest and AdaBoost
- Implementations from scratch and via libraries

> Ideal for students or those looking to solidify core ML skills.

### [`brainstrom zone`](https://github.com/yourusername/ml-tasks/tree/Brainstorm zone)
A practical, evolving collection of:
- Task-based notebooks (e.g., Titanic classification, image recognition)
- Unsupervised learning like K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means
- CNN, LSTM, SVM hybrid models
- Data preprocessing utilities and exploratory analysis

> Great for hands-on learners and project-based exploration.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-tasks.git
cd ml-tasks
```

2. Switch to a specific branch:
```bash
git checkout assignment      # for core exercises
# or
git checkout brainstrom zone     # for task-based notebooks
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
